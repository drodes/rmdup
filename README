Name     : rmdup (ReMove DUPlicate files).
Llicense : The MIT License (MIT).
Premise  : If keys generated from different files are equal, then the files are exactly the same, despite having a different name.
Goal     : Generate a script to remove duplicate files of a directory, except the last copy of each file.
           And show information about duplicate files:
           - How many files are unique.
           - How many files are duplicates.
           - Total number of copies .
           - Amount of space you get if you remove copies.
Require  : sqlite3
Usage    : ./rmdup directory
           directory: directory where you want to find duplicate files (full path).
RUNNING  : The process records all the files in a database. This database is overwritten each time you run this script.
           We generate a unique hash for each file. Those that have the same hash are duplicates. 
           Finally, displays information about the duplicate files and generates a script prepared to remove duplicate files while retaining most recent.
           If you don't run the script, it will not remove any files.

EXAMPLE  : See testing_script
